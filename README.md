his calculator helps you determine the frequency and amount to withdraw based on your investment and profit targets. The goal is to recover your initial investment efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. **Investment Amount (INR)**: The total amount you initially invest.
2. **Profit Target (INR)**: The profit threshold you aim to reach before making a withdrawal.
3. **Withdrawal Amount ($)**: The amount you want to withdraw each time you reach the profit target.
**Logic**: Imagine your investment as a pot of money. Every time your profits fill this pot to a certain level (your profit target), you take a portion out (withdrawal amount). You keep doing this until you've taken out all the money you initially put in multiple times.
